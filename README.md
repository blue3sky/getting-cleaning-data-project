---------------------------------------
This file describes how all of the script and dataset work and how they are connected:
- Create a working directory (e.g. C:/getting-cleaning-data-project) for the project
- Develop and save the run_analysis.R script in the working directory
- Download and extract the dataset "UCI HAR Dataset" folder into the working directory
- Open run_analysis.R script and execute the script from RStudio
- If the script is successfully executed, the required dataset "tidy_data.txt" will be created in the working directory
